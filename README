These are the amazing source files for the new SproutCore marketing website.  

Like the rest of SproutCore, the website itself is open source as well.  If 
you find typos or think of something that would help improve the website, feel 
free to fork this repository and make the changes.  You can then send a 
pull request to sproutit on github so we can pull in your new change.

== How an amazing Website Is Built

SproutCore's build tools have a built-in facility for generating 
cache-optimized, multi-lingual web pages as well as full cloud applications.
We use these tools to generate our website as well.  

In this repository you'll find a "pages" directory.  This contains the assets
for each individual page.  the .rhtml files in the .lproj directories contain
most of the HTML.  We can also add JavaScript and CSS here if needed as well.

TODO: The process described below is still in progress. 

Whenever we make a commit to the "deploy" branch on the sproutit version of
the repository on github, it triggers a post-commit call to the server which
will automatically checkout a new copy of the website and rebuild it.  This 
is the bin/deploy script.
