This website is generated using the nanoc gem. It also uses rainpress to compress the CSS files. To install, type:

  gem install nanoc rainpress mime-types
  
You can then run:
  
  nano compile

to generate the final version. You can also see your changes as they happen
by running:

  nanoc autocompile

This will cause nanoc to recompile every time a file in the current directory
changes. Look in the output/ directory for the built product.
